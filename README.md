# Bai's Recommended Books and Papers

I love reading anything and everything I can get my hands on, but some things are more worth-reading than others. Here, I'm going to collect a list of books and papers I've read that I think are interesting.

In this list I'll just write the title, year of publication, and 1-2 primary authors, as I'm too lazy to cite everything in proper MLA format. Hopefully it will be clear what papers I'm referring to.

# General Nonfiction Books

Books in this category are written for a general audience, and can be read from cover to cover without any special knowledge.

* **GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach (aka GEB)** by Douglas Hofstadter (1979). This is my go-to book when people ask me what my favorite book is. I read it over a summer break in high school; it talks about a lot of ideas like logic systems, recursion, and self reference, and eventually leads to an informal proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem! It's over 500 pages but I loved every bit of it, and after really understanding this book, CS245 was a cakewalk.

* **Our Marvelous Native Tongue** by Robert Claiborne (1983). If I were to choose a single book that had the biggest impact on my life, this would be it. This book is what first got me interested in linguistics and languages in general. It tells the history of the English language, from its ancient Indo-European roots to Anglo-Saxon to the modern English we speak today. After reading it, I gained a new appreciation for learning Chinese and French, which previously I thought of as a chore. A must-read for all English speakers!

* **Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software** by Charles Petzold (1999). This book explains how computers work, and how you could've built one yourself out of magnets and telegraph relays. It's a fascinating read that really demystifies what's happening inside a computer. I first tried to read it in elementary school, but got lost somewhere in the middle; everything made more sense when I read it again after having programmed for a while.

* **The Black Swan** by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2007). Cautionary advice telling you not to trust your models too much. "Black Swan" events are highly impactful yet impossible to predict; Taleb gives advice on how to set up your life so you benefit from these types of events.

* **The Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins (1976). A lot of interesting and slightly controversial ideas in this book. It introduces some concepts from evolutionary biology and explains a lot of sociological phenomena in terms of evolution and how a certain behaviour increases an individual's chances of reproduction, which is ultimately what a gene cares about.

* **The Emperor Far Away** by David Eimer (2014). A foreigner travels around the borderlands of China and describes the various cultures of the ethnic minorities. In particular, Xishuangbanna (region in southern Yunnan province) sounded so interesting that I decided to visit there myself when I traveled to China.

* **A Random Walk Down Wall Street** by Burton G. Malkiel (2007). A very readable overview of the theory of investing and stock markets: a theory of how speculation works, why technical analysis is dumb and you should just buy index funds, and an introduction to financial derivatives. Might be a bit too advanced for your first book on investing though.
